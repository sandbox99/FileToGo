# FileToGo

This is a small but practically useful tool for setting up a web server on a machine in a few seconds, and then you can 
visit its uploading page from other machines to transfer files to it, no needing resorting to ftp, sftp, rsync, QQ, etc.

Although it was built with Go, you can run it without Go environment.
